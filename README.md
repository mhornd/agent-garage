# Agent Garage: A GenAI Reference Architecture

**Agent Garage** is an open-source project aimed at building a reference architecture for a generative AI (GenAI) platform using open-source software. It is designed to serve as a starting point for creating agentic AI workflows and exploring modular, self-hosted AI solutions.

This platform is built to support **exploration**, **experimentation** and **development** with AI agents. It offers a practical environment for any user who wants to understand how intelligent AI-agents can be used to automate tasks, solve problems, or implement custom workflows. Whether you want to try out existing agents, adapt them to your needs, or build entirely new solutions, the agent garage provides a flexible and accessible starting point.

This project builds upon the foundation of the **Self-hosted AI Starter Kit**, curated by <https://github.com/n8n-io>, which combines the self-hosted n8n platform with a curated list of compatible AI products and components.

## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/twodigits/agent-garage.git
cd agent-garage
```

### Running the Multi-Container System

A container engine is required to run this multi-container system. Either Docker or Podman can be used. One of these must be selected prior to installation, as it serves as the foundational component for hosting the containers.

### Using Docker Compose

#### For Nvidia GPU Users

```bash
git clone https://github.com/twodigits/agent-garage.git
cd agent-garage
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not used your Nvidia GPU with Docker before, please follow the
> [Ollama Docker instructions](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/docker.md).

#### For AMD GPU Users on Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/twodigits/agent-garage.git
cd agent-garage
docker compose --profile gpu-amd up
```

#### For Mac / Apple Silicon Users

If you’re using a Mac with an M1 or newer processor, you can't expose your GPU
to the Docker instance, unfortunately. There are two options in this case:

1. Run the starter kit fully on CPU, like in the section "For everyone else"
   below
2. Run Ollama on your Mac for faster inference, and connect to that from the
   n8n instance

If you want to run Ollama on your Mac, check the
[Ollama homepage](https://ollama.com/)
for installation instructions, and run the starter kit as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/twodigits/agent-garage.git
cd agent-garage
docker compose up
```

##### For Mac Users Running Ollama Locally

If you're running Ollama locally on your Mac (not in Docker), you need to modify the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable
in the n8n service configuration. Update the x-n8n section in your Docker Compose file as follows:

```yaml
x-n8n: &service-n8n 
  # ... other configurations ...
  environment:
    # ... other environment variables ...
    - OLLAMA_HOST=host.docker.internal:11434
```

Additionally, after you see "Editor is now accessible via: <http://localhost:5678/>":

1. Head to <http://localhost:5678/home/credentials>
2. Click on "Local Ollama service"
3. Change the base URL to "http://host.docker.internal:11434/"

#### For Everyone Else (CPU Only)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/twodigits/agent-garage.git
cd agent-garage
docker compose --profile cpu up
```

### Using Podman

#### For Nvidia GPU Users

```bash
podman compose --profile gpu-nvidia --file docker-compose.yml up
```

#### For AMD GPU Users on Linux

```bash
podman compose --profile gpu-amd --file docker-compose.yml up
```

#### For Mac / Apple Silicon Users

If you’re using a Mac with an M1 or newer processor, you can't expose your GPU
to the Docker instance, unfortunately. There are two options in this case:

1. Run the multi-container system fully on CPU, like in the section "For Everyone Else (CPU Only)"
   below
2. Run Ollama on your Mac for faster inference, and connect to that from the
   n8n instance

```bash
podman compose --file docker-compose.yml up
```

#### For Everyone Else (CPU Only)

```bash
podman compose --profile cpu --file docker-compose.yml up
```

## 🚀 Getting Started with the Agent Garage

### Key Goals of the Platform

- Use and interact with **preconfigured AI agents**

- Create your **own workflows** using modular components

- Get started quickly thanks to **labeled and guided workflows**

All workflows in n8n are clearly labeled and structured, making it easy to understand their purpose and discover how agents are connected.
The agent garage encourages to follow, explore, and build on the existing components.
This makes the platform an ideal starting point for working with agent-based automation, open-ended, guided, and ready for your own ideas.

The core of Agent Garage is a Docker Compose file, pre-configured with network and storage settings, minimizing the need for additional installations. After completing the installation steps above, follow these steps to get started.

### n8n

1. Navigate to http://localhost:5678
2. The Registration form will appear.
3. Enter the requested data. However, these do not have to be valid, as the e-mail address is not checked. You only have to set this up once.

   ![alt text](readme_images/SetUp-n8n.png)

4. The dashboard will be loaded.

### Open WebUI

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 .The Sign In page will appear:

   ![alt text](readme_images/sign_in_n8n.png)

2. Use the following credentials to sign in:

   Email: admin@test.com

   Password: S2yjzup!3

3. After login, the chat interface is visible.

**Disclaimer:** Open WebUI is still under active development and is intended for experimentation and testing only. It is not recommended for production use. You may occasionally experience display delays within the Open WebUI interface. In this case, reloading the page or waiting a few seconds will usually solve the problem.

### Further steps

When opening the n8n interface, you’ll see an overview of all available workflows .

![alt text](readme_images/n8n-Dashboard.png)

There are two main categories of workflows:

🟥 **Simple Entry Workflow**

The User Story Creator workflow is highlighted with a red border.

It represents the simplest entry point into the system and is ideal for getting started.
This workflow is based on a single AI agent and lets you directly try out user story generation.
We recommend starting with this workflow to explore the basics before diving into the full multi-agent architecture.

🟩 **Multi-Agent System Workflows**

Workflows belonging to the multi-agent system are marked with a green border. The structure follows a clear hierarchy:

- The **Manager-Agent** is labeled with the number **2**.

- The connected sub-agents are numbered 2.1 to 2.4, each handling a specific task (e.g. log analysis, bug reporting, Jira interaction, user story generation).

- These workflows belong together and operate as a collaborative system coordinated by the Manager-Agent.

🟪 **Advanced Automation Workflows**

Advanced workflows demonstrate sophisticated multi-agent orchestration:

- The **Spec-Driven Developer** (labeled 3) is a comprehensive workflow that transforms project ideas into complete specification packages using 11 specialized LLM agents working in sequence and parallel.

---

### 1. Simple Workflow – _User Story Creator_

For an easy first step, use the **User Story Creator** workflow in **n8n**. This workflow is designed to explore the basic functionality and interaction with the chat interface of **Open WebUI**.

- 🔧 **Technically**, the workflow is based on a single AI-Agent that creates structured User Stories.

- ✅ **Goal**: Get quick results & understand the platform basics

### How it works:

1. Double click on the User Story Creator workflow

   ![alt text](readme_images/User-Story-Creator-n8n.png)

2. Take a moment to review the explanations in the workflow and explore AI agents in n8n.
3. Activate the workflow by clicking the Active Button:

   ![alt text](readme_images/Activated-Workflow.png)

4. In the chat interface of **Open WebUI** , select the **User Story Creator** chat from the list:

   ![alt text](readme_images/User-Story-Creator-Chat.png)

5. Enter a request (e.g. “Create a user story for a login function”) via the chat interface and start interacting with the User Story Creator!

This entry point is ideal for getting familiar with the **core concepts** of the platform and testing your own ideas.

### 2. Next Level: Multi-Agent System with Supervisor Architecture

For the next step, use the **Multi-Agent System** workflow in **n8n**. This workflow is designed to demonstrate how multiple specialized AI agents collaborate under a supervisor architecture to handle selected tasks from the software development process.
It consists of several specialized AI agents that work together to solve more complex tasks related to selected aspects of the software development process.

- 👥 Agents are clearly separated and each focuses on a specific task within the software development process.
- 🧠 The **Supervisor Architecture** ensures that a central agent (Manager-Agent) coordinates workflows and distributes tasks

- 🔧 **Technically**, the workflow is coordinated by a central **Manager-Agent**, which delegates tasks to other specialized agents ( User-Story-Agent, Logfile-Agent, Bugreport-Agent, Jira-Agent).

- ✅ **Goal**: Understand agent collaboration

### How it works:

1. Double click on the **Manager-Agent** workflow

   ![alt text](readme_images/Manager-Agent.png)

2. Take a moment to review the explanations in the workflow and explore how the Manager-Agent and the other AI agents interact in **n8n**.
3. Activate the workflow by clicking the Active Button:

   ![alt text](readme_images/Activated-Manager-Agent.png)

4. In the chat interface of **Open WebUI**, select the chat named **SDLC Agents**:

   ![alt text](readme_images/SDLC-Agents-Chat.png)

5. Enter a request (e.g. “Analyze this log file and create a bug report”) via the chat interface. The Manager-Agent will automatically coordinate the involved agents and return the result to you.

### Overview: Specialized Agents in the Multi-Agent System

| Agent Name           | Responsibility                                            | Input / Artifacts                                                          | Output / Artifacts                                                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Jira-Agent**       | - Creating, searching, and updating tickets               | - Ticket change <br> - Search request for ticket <br> - Ticket description | - Correctly modified data in Jira                                     |
| **Logfile-Agent**    | - Analysis of logfiles for critical bugs and stack traces | -Logfile                                                                   | - Detailed analysis of bugs (error description, cause of error, etc.) |
| **Bugreport-Agent**  | - Generating structured bug reports based on analysis     | - Detailed description of a bug                                            | - Bugreport                                                           |
| **User-Story-Agent** | - Generating structured user stories from requests        | - Idea for software feature                                                | - User story                                                          |

#### Known Limitations

- **Open WebUI Timeout Behaviour**: Open WebUI might run into timeouts on smaller models due to longer processing times. It seems that Open WebUI resends some data, which then results in multiple executions that make less and less sense as they contain partial information and partial chat history too.

### 3. Advanced Workflow: Spec-Driven Developer

The **Spec-Driven Developer** is a comprehensive n8n workflow that transforms high-level project ideas into complete, specification-driven development documentation. This advanced workflow demonstrates the power of multi-agent orchestration for automating complex, multi-stage processes.

- **Caller Policy**: workflowsFromSameOwner
- **LLM Agents**: 11 specialized agents with custom system and user messages
- **Output Format**: Tarball containing organized markdown and YAML files

## 💡 Notes

### Model Configuration

The Llama 3.2 model is installed by default. You can easily configure different models using environment variables.

#### Quick Start: Change the Primary Model

1. Edit the `.env` file:
   ```bash
   OLLAMA_MODEL=mixtral
   ```

2. Restart the containers:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up  # or your profile
   ```

#### Using Multiple Models

To pull multiple models on startup for different workflows:

1. Edit the `.env` file:
   ```bash
   OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2
   OLLAMA_ADDITIONAL_MODELS=mixtral,codellama,phi3  # comma-separated
   ```

Note: For `OLLAMA_MODEL` and `OLLAMA_ADDITIONAL_MODELS` double check which
version of Ollama is required to run them. It might be they are available only
in pre-release versions, which are not tagged as `:latest` in Docker Hub and thus pulling them might fail. Identify the running version with `docker exec -it ollama ollama -v`

2. Restart as above

Available models: [Ollama Library](https://ollama.com/library)

**Note**: Model changes in n8n workflows must be done manually via the n8n UI:
1. Open the workflow in n8n
2. Click on the "Ollama Chat Model" node
3. Change the model field (e.g., from "llama3.2:latest" to "mixtral:latest")
4. Save the workflow

### Change logfile

The **Logfile Agent** has access to a specific log file (`test.log`) located within the project folder.  
If the log file is replaced or renamed, make sure to update the corresponding path and filename in the **n8n workflow** of the Logfile Agent to ensure correct analysis.

### Setting up Jira to use the Jira-Agent

1. Navigate to http://localhost:8080
2. The Jira-Setup page will be visible

3. Select Database Type PostgreSQL and fill in the required fields. Default values are provided in the `.env` file.

![alt text](readme_images/Jira-Database-Setup.png)

4. The application properties can be adopted by default.

![alt text](readme_images/Jira-Application-Properties.png)

5. The next step is to generate a Server ID, which is required to use Jira. In addition, a Jira license must be available to which the Server ID is linked. If the license is not available, click on the “Generate a new trial license” for jira Software (Data Center) with the link below.

![alt text](readme_images/Jira-License-Key.png)

6. Now, Jira can be configured and projects can be set up. Note that only “tasks” exist as issue types in the jira version. The issue types "Story" and "Bug" must first be configured.
Click on Settings at the top right of your profile, select Issues from the menu and configure the issue types Story and Bug as shown in the image.

![alt text](readme_images/Jira_issue_types.png)

7. In order to link Jira with the n8n workflows, adapt the `.env` file.

### Create and configure personal access tokens

1. Log in to your profile and open Settings.

2. Select Personal Access Tokens in the left sidebar.

3. Click on Create new token to create a token.

4. Copy the generated token and paste it into the `.env` file:

   JIRA_PERSONAL_TOKEN=your_token

### Create project and store metadata

1. Create a new repository or project in your GitHub organization or user account.

2. Enter the following information in the .env file:

   JIRA_USERNAME=your_username

   JIRA_PROJECT=project_key

## 🔗 OpenWebUI and n8n Integration Architecture

### Platform Architecture

The platform leverages containerization technology, where each component runs in its own container connected through a shared virtual network. This architecture provides:

- Hardware independence and platform portability
- Low entry barrier for new users
- Simplified deployment with minimal setup steps

### How the Integration Works

#### Communication Flow

1. **User Input**: Users interact with the platform through OpenWebUI's chat interface, submitting requests for AI agent processing

2. **n8n-Pipe Function**: OpenWebUI uses a custom Python function called "n8n-pipe" to bridge communication with n8n:

   - Intercepts user messages instead of sending them directly to an AI model
   - Forwards requests to n8n workflows via webhooks
   - Maintains session management for continuous conversations

3. **Webhook Trigger**: n8n receives the message through a webhook endpoint, which triggers the appropriate workflow containing the MAS implementation

4. **Agent Processing**: Within n8n workflows:

   - AI agents access Large Language Models (LLMs) through Ollama
   - Agents can interact with external systems (e.g., Jira) via MCP clients
   - Multiple specialized agents collaborate to process the request

5. **Response Delivery**: The generated response is sent back to OpenWebUI via webhook, where it's formatted with features like:
   - Markdown rendering
   - Code syntax highlighting
   - Structured message display

### The n8n-Pipe Function

The n8n-pipe is a Python function that bridges OpenWebUI with n8n workflows. Key features include:

- **Webhook Configuration**: Configurable n8n webhook URL and bearer token authentication
- **Field Mapping**: Customizable input and output field names for data exchange
- **Status Indicators**: Real-time status emissions to show workflow progress
- **Session Management**: Maintains session IDs for conversation continuity
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and reporting

### Integration with External Systems

The platform extends existing tools rather than replacing them. Through n8n's extensive node library and MCP support, AI agents can:

- Retrieve information from connected systems
- Update data in external tools
- Create new entries (e.g., Jira tickets)
- Reduce manual data entry through automation

### Technical Considerations

While the current implementation demonstrates technical feasibility and serves as an excellent proof of concept, please note:

- This is designed for experimentation and educational purposes
- Security, scalability, and reliability aspects would need enhancement for production use
- The underlying concept can be adapted for enterprise-ready solutions

## 🤖 Chat-based Workflow Creation with n8n-MCP

Agent Garage becomes even more powerful with the n8n-MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server! This enables you to create n8n workflows directly through chat interactions in AI development environments like Claude, Windsurf, or Cursor - without having to dig through the complete n8n documentation.

### What is n8n-MCP?

The n8n-MCP Server gives AI assistants comprehensive access to n8n node documentation and enables:

- Chat-based workflow creation without deep n8n knowledge
- Smart node search and suggestions
- Validation of node configurations before deployment
- Access to more than 500 n8n nodes with extensive property coverage

### Quick Start

1. **Installation via npx (recommended):**

   ```bash
   npx n8n-mcp
   ```

2. **Configure in your AI development environment:**

   - Add the MCP server to your Claude/Cursor/Windsurf configuration
   - Start a new chat and describe your desired workflow

3. **Create workflows:**
   Simply describe in chat what you want to automate:
   ```
   "Create a workflow that daily fetches emails from Gmail,
   saves attachments to Google Drive, and sends a Slack notification"
   ```

### Benefits for Agent Garage Users

- **No n8n expertise required:** The AI assistant translates your requirements into working workflows
- **Faster development:** From idea to workflow in minutes instead of hours

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Accessing Local Files

Agent Garage will create a shared folder (by default, located in the same directory) which is mounted to the n8n container and allows n8n to access files on disk. This folder within the n8n container is
located at `/data/shared` -- this is the path you’ll need to use in nodes that
interact with the local filesystem.

**Nodes that interact with the local filesystem:**

- [Read/Write Files from Disk](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.filesreadwrite/)
- [Local File Trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.localfiletrigger/)
- [Execute Command](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/)
